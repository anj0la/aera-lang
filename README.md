# Aera Programming Language

A statically-typed, safe and simple programming language designed as an evolutionary step forward from C++, preserving control and performance while introducing ad-hoc polymorphism, compile-time safety and clean syntax.

## Overview

Aera is designed for developing interactive applications, such as games and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It transpiles to C++, allowing you to leverage mature compiler backends while enjoying modern language features and safety guarantees.

## Core Principles

Aera operates on four core principles that guide its design:

- **Performance** - Compiled language with source-to-source compilation to C++, ownership-based memory management without garbage collection
- **Flexibility** - Trait system for compositional programming, smooth C++ and C interoperability
- **Usability** - Clean, readable syntax inspired by Python and Go, explicit error handling with ? and ?? operators
- **Control** - Explicit memory management with safe pointer types, unsafe operations contained in explicit bind blocks

## Quick Example

*Coming soon - Aera is currently in specification and early development phase.*

## Current Status

Aera is currently in development. Version 0.1 will include:

- Complete lexer and parser
- Transpiler to C++
- Basic syntax support (variables, operators, expressions)
- Control flow constructs
- Function declarations and calls
- Structs and classes
- Traits
- Primitive data types
- Terminal I/O library
